<h3 id="mean">What does HTML mean?</h3>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  
There are many markup languages, of which HTML is one.  
The language is designed to send a mix of text content and 
links to other content to the user's web browser.</p>

<h3 id="do">What does HTML Do?</h3>
<p> HTML defines the method in which text and images can be 
integrated by a web browser.  The browser is responsible for 
interpreting the document correctly and displaying it in a 
fashion that integrates text with other
content such as images.</p>

<h3 id="style">What is a Style Sheet?</h3>
<p>A stylesheet is a document containing one or more style 
definitions.  These definitions control the look of a web 
page.  The same style sheet can be linked to multiple 
documents allowing a single point of control for the look
of your web page.</p>
 
<h3 id="link">How do I link to another web page?</h3>
<p>As discussed earlier in the chapter, the anchor tag (<a>) 
provides the mechanism by which a web page makes clickable links 
to other web pages.  The href attribute is the key to defining 
the link.</p> 

<h3 id="tool">What tool do we use to edit HTML?</h3>
<p>Numerous tools exist for editing web pages.  You can use something 
as simple at NotePad++, Bracket, Microsoft's Expression, or Adobe Dreamweaver.</p>
