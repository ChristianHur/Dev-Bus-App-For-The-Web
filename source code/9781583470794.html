          	<p>Written by business developers for business developers, this book focuses on HTML for business applications. Using this guide, professional business programmers like you--even those with little or no HTML experience--will quickly acquire the knowledge and skills needed to develop and deploy robust, data-driven, Web-based interfaces for their business applications.<br>
          	  <br>
          	  <em>HTML for the Business Developer</em> isn't just another "HTML 101" book for the masses. It zeros in on those aspects of HTML that pertain specifically to the business environment and covers a wide range of technologies beyond simple HTML to show complete deployment of business applications using an HTML interface. It also explores the most common tools any business programmer needs to develop browser-based applications with enterprise data, such as JavaServer Pages, PHP, ASP.NET, CGI, and JavaScript.<br>
          	  <br>
       	    Business developers shouldn't have to sift through every last detail of HTML minutiae. Nor must they become an expert in every Web language "out there."<em>HTML for the Business Developer</em> is the business developer's guide to the essence of these technologies. Led by its two knowledgeable and experienced authors, you will be able to develop and implement a complete browser-based business application in no time at all.</p>
